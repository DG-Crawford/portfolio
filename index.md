Welcome. I'm a senior technical writer with experience in Confluence, ServiceNow, SharePoint, and Wikis within the Cloud and Medical fields. My current focus is on AI systems, internal tooling, and documentation strategy. This site showcases my work across infrastructure SOPs, content system design, and other technical writing projects.
This portfolio includes:
- SOPs and process guides written for infrastructure and operations teams
- AI transcription pipeline documentation built for privacy-focused local systems
- Design and deployment of a SharePoint + Teams-based documentation hub
Check out some of my recent works below.
