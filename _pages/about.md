I'm a technical writer specializing in AI, cloud infrastructure, and system-level documentation. My background includes translating complex architectures into readable, scalable documentation that supports engineers, developers, and operations teams.

This site is a portfolio of my work, with a particular focus on tools, workflows, and writing systems at the intersection of AI and technical writing.
