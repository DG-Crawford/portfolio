I'm a senior technical writer focused on AI systems, infrastructure documentation, and scalable content platforms. My background includes creating live doc hubs, refining internal knowledge bases, and accelerating cross-team workflows through writing systemsâ€”not just individual docs.

This portfolio includes:
- SOPs and process guides written for infrastructure and operations teams
- AI transcription pipeline documentation built for privacy-focused local systems
- Design and deployment of a SharePoint + Teams-based documentation hub
